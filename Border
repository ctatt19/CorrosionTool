img = imread(pic);%this reads a file ( you must type in the file name and be sure that it is in the same folder as this script)
I = rgb2gray(img); %changes image from rgb color scheme to gray
[x,map] = gray2ind(I,100); %take the image and maps the gray scale to 100 different shades
bw2=im2bw(x,map,0.45); % takes the gray scale and makes it black and white
wb = imcomplement(bw2); %changes the image to white and black (inverse the black and white)
regionwb=bwareaopen(wb,300); %this takes     any area that is 350 pixels or less and fills it with black you can see this from figure 1 to 2
region_borders1 = imdilate(regionwb,ones(3,3)) > imerode(regionwb,ones(2,3)); %this will make the border of the image 
region_borders2 = bwareaopen(region_borders1,300);%Found this way to be a better way of producing the border Included previous version to show you the difference
